Sosed - source code topic modeling
 measure the distance between arbitrary pieces of code (and even projects!)
 Firstly, we took a large corpus of sub-token sequences and trained their embeddings with fasttext. Then, we clustered the embeddings with spherical K-means to get 256 groups of semantically similar tokens. These clusters reflect topics that occurred at sub-token level in a large corpus of source code
 all the repositories on GitHub as of the end of 2016 in a dataset of 9 million GitHub repositories from the paper by Markovtsev et al
the range of topics is very broad, from "CPU fans" to "Large Hadron Collider"

doc2query - given an input span of text, predicts a natural language query that the text might answer
 document expansion
-
uniCOIL - doc2query output can be appended to the original documents, which together serve as input to a retrieval model that exploits learnedsparse lexical representations . This class of models (typically based on transformers) takes advantage of training data to learn term weights that are effective for retrieval. In this context, doc2query output provides a candidate set of termsthat should receive non-zero weights
